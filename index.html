        <p>Hi Faye🌷</p>

        <p>I've been thinking a lot lately, and I wanted to be honest with you.</p>

        <p>I know I moved a bit too fast before. I let my feelings take over, and I get that it changed the pace of things. I'm sorry if it made anything feel overwhelming.</p>

        <p>I really miss how easy it felt when we talked. I miss the excitement, the random conversations, and those small moments that meant so much. I still remember the time we stayed up talking about silly things and laughed until our cheeks hurt. Those moments made everything feel light and easy, and I miss that a lot.</p>

        <p>I've been trying to slow down and understand my feelings better. I realize now that moving too fast can complicate things, and I want to improve—not just for myself, but for anyone I care about.</p>

        <p>I'm not writing this to rush anything again. I just wanted you to know that what we had meant something to me.</p>

        <p>I know you're busy, and I understand. I also realize you may need space, and I respect that too.</p>

        <p>I hope that someday, if the timing feels right, we can talk and laugh like we used to—without any rush or expectation. Just enjoying the moments as they come.</p>

        <p>Even if things don’t go back to how they were, I'm grateful for the time we shared and the happiness it brought me. No pressure. Just a sincere note from me. </p>
