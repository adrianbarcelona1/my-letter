        <p>Hi Faye🌷</p>

        <p>I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I wanted to express this properly.</p>

        <p>Meeting you has truly been one of the best parts of my year. Even though we haven't met in person yet, you’ve made a real impact on my life. You’re kind, caring, and genuine in a way that feels rare. I’m really grateful for you.</p>
        
        <p>I also want to acknowledge that I moved a bit fast before. I let my feelings guide me, and I see now how that could have changed the pace of things. I’m sorry for that. I respect you and your feelings, and I’m more aware of that now.</p>
        
        <p>You’ve helped me see life differently. You’ve shown me how to stay kind even after tough experiences, how not to take things for granted, and how much good still exists in the world. Because of you, I’ve been trying to improve myself. I’ll always appreciate that.</p>
        
        <p>I really miss how easy our conversations felt. The random talks, the laughs, the simple moments that meant a lot. I still remember the time we stayed up talking about silly things and laughed until our cheeks hurt. Those moments were light and genuine.</p>

        <p>I wanted you to know that what we shared meant something to me, and I’m thankful for it. No expectations—just appreciation.</p>

        <p>I truly hope good things keep coming your way. You deserve happiness, growth, and all the good life has to offer.</p>

        <p>Thank you for being you and for the light you brought into my life.</p>
